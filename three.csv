"how to build patience n emotional resilience in 11 old.how to build strong bond with 11 year old. we play chess, monopoly, badminton in free time,also watch movies,we have fun n laughter when we accompany each other. is this enough or else what i need to do?","You're already doing a wonderful job by spending quality time, playing games, and sharing laughter—these activities are key to building a strong bond. To further build patience and emotional resilience in your 11-year-old:

1. Model calm behavior: Children learn by watching—respond to stress with patience.
2. Encourage expression: Create a safe space for them to talk about feelings without judgment.
3. Teach problem-solving: Let them face small challenges and guide them in finding solutions.
4. Praise effort, not just results: This builds a growth mindset.
5. Practice mindfulness or deep breathing together: Just 5 minutes a day helps regulate emotions."
what are home remedies to improve appetite in 10 months old baby ,"                                Hi Teja,

There are many things you can do to increase your baby’s appetite — not only to gain weight but to improve your baby’s nutritional intake as well, such as:

Giving them a variety of textures and flavours like bananas, sweet potatoes, eggs, meat (introduced after six months), and cheese (introduced after eight months).
Encouraging tummy time, rolling on the floor, and any other physical activity your baby is able to do.
Offering new food along with foods you know your baby likes — don’t be afraid to try giving the new food more than once either.
Preparing the same food in different ways. Maybe your baby isn’t a fan of whole bananas but will drink them in a smoothie with other fruit, for example.
Limiting mealtime to 20 minutes max and making sure there are no distractions, such as a TV or iPad.
A glass of water is one of the best appetite boosting ideas. Give one in the morning and have the baby take more before meals. But, avoid giving water together with meals, it activates the digestive juices, which improves digestion and also boosts your baby''s appetite. So, your baby will likely get starved and eat more.
